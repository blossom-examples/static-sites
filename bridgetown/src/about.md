# About Blossom Cloud

Blossom Cloud is a modern application deployment platform that helps developers deploy their applications to their own servers with ease. Our mission is to provide a simple, cost-effective solution for deploying applications of any kind.

- **Control**: We give you full control over your infrastructure.
- **Cost-Effectiveness**: We help you save money by using your own servers.
- **Transparency**: We are transparent about our pricing and our technology.

## Our Team

Our team consists of experienced developers and DevOps engineers who have worked with a wide range of technologies and deployment solutions. We understand the challenges that developers face when deploying applications, and we're committed to making the process as smooth as possible.
